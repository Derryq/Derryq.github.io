     <h2>Intelligent warning device for pedestrians and motor vehicles</h2>
     <h3>Quan Yuan</h3>
     </span>
     <p class="p2">【Abstract】Based on the common simple sensor and single-chip microcomputer principle, aiming at the occurrence and reasons of "ghost probe" and the problem of no effective coping methods, a "smart warning device for pedestrians and motor vehicles" is proposed. The device is aimed at the current traffic situation and road conditions, especially the part of the vision sheltering, pedestrians and motor vehicles can not predict and self-protection is not strong. Realize effective reminders for traffic participants and enable pedestrians and vehicles to see each other's walking status so as to effectively avoid risks.

     <p>Application for the summer camp at Southern University of Science and Technology</p>
     <p>Dear Mr./Mrs.</p>
     <div>
     <p>My name is Yuan Quan. I'm a 18-year-old senior high school student who is from the Shanxi Experimental Secondary School. To be honest, as a modest individual, I'm not good at making a self-recommendation or introduction. But it is also proud for me to present my qualities which truly belong to me.  Now I will list the reasons why I can be a good candidate for the summer camp at Southern University of Science and Technology.</p>
     <p>First, I have the experience of studying in America for half a year. Last year, I studied as a exchange student in Connecticut, America, which provide me with the experience of communicating with foreigners in English and daily studying in an English country. These skills let me be more familiar with spoken English and the mode of English thinking. As a result, it is easier for me to get used to the courses of SUSTech's summer camp in
     English.</p>
     <p>Second, I am interested in programming and computer science. I believe that interest is a good reason of accepting me as a good candidate. What's more, I have some basic knowledge about programming and I also have learned C language for half a year. So I have the chance to get close to the web page design course. This year, in 2018, I participated Maker Game held by HKY in Institute of Automation，Chinese Academy of Sciences, and won the national second prize finally. It is my experience of creation. I think that I can have good comprehension of this curriculum and take in more knowledge from it.</p>
     <p>Finally, to be subjective, Southern University of Science and Technology is one of my desired university for its model of creative academic and educational environment. The SUSTech's summer camp is a nice opportunity for me to know more about this school in advance, such as its social and natural environment, its science devices especially, its library and etc. If I can be chosen, it will be my honor to get touch with this famous university.</p>
     <p>Thank you for reading my self-recommendation.</p>

     <p class="p4">Yours,</p>
